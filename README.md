## Layout Tools and CSS Functions used

### Flexbox
- Used for arranging items within the `card`, `card__result` and `card__summary` sections, providing a flexible, responsive layout.

### CSS Functions 

In this project, various CSS functions are employed to achieve specific styling effects. Here's an overview of the CSS functions and their purposes:

### `hsl()`
- **Purpose**: Used for defining colors.
- **Example**: `hsl(0, 100%, 67%)` is applied to create the light red color used as the background for the result section.

### `hsla()`
- **Purpose**: Used for defining colors with transparency.
- **Example**: `hsla(0, 100%, 67%, 0.1)` sets the light red background with some transparency.

### `var()`
- **Purpose**: Enables the use of CSS variables to maintain consistency in color and typography.
- **Example**: Variables like `--light-red` and `--dark-gray-blue` are used throughout the project to define colors and maintain a consistent style.

### `clamp()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the card width is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Example**: `clamp(300px, 90vw, 720px)` is applied to set the width of the card, ensuring it doesn't get too narrow or too wide on different screens.

### `linear-gradient()`
- **Purpose**: Creates gradient backgrounds.
- **Example**: Used for creating gradient backgrounds in various sections, such as the result section and the "Continue" button.

### `hsla()`
- **Purpose**: Defines colors with hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha (transparency) components.
- **Example**: `hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1)` is applied for the violet-blue color in the result section.

## Media Queries

### `@media (max-width: 650px)`
- Stacks the `card` sections vertically for smaller screens, improving mobile user experience.
- Adapts spacing and alignment of the `summary__title` for better readability.
- Adjusts the margin of the "Continue" link for an improved user interface.
